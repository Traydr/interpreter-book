# Interpreter-book
The interpreter book in a few languages, which can be found [here](https://interpreterbook.com/).

## Whats being worked on

- `csharp/` currently working on this
- `go/` created this, but no work has gone into it yet

## Motivation

I saw ThePrimeagen start his series on the book and was intrigued about it. 
After a couple of days of going over it in my head I decided to purchase it.
So far the book has been pretty good, although my own decision to do it in c# means that there were hickups in my decision making ( see the ast commits ).
